WARNING:
--------
FOR SECURITY REASONS, USING A JAVASCRIPT WEB APP HOSTED VIA THE CORDA NODE IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED WAY TO INTERFACE
WITH CORDA NODES! HOWEVER, FOR THIS PRE-ALPHA RELEASE IT'S A USEFUL WAY TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE PLATFORM AS IT ALLOWS
YOU TO QUICKLY BUILD A UI FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES.

GOING FORWARD WE RECOMMEND IMPLEMENTING A STANDALONE WEB SERVER THAT AUTHORISES VIA THE NODE'S RPC INTERFACE. IN THE
COMING WEEKS, WE'LL WRITE A TUTORIAL ON HOW BEST TO DO THIS.
